llrec holds a function that splits a linked list into two based on a pivot, and one that filters a linked list based on a comparator.
To test llrec, you must provide an input file with a list.

heap.h is an implementation of a m-ary heap that has the functions push, pop, top, empty, size, trickleUp, and trickleDown (heapify).
The heap takes in a comparator to be either a min-heap or a max-heap.
logicsim uses this heap to simulate an and, or, and not circuit.
To use the logicsim, you must provide an input file with the input wires.
